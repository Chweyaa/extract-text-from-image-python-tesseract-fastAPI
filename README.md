# extract-text-from-image-python-tesseract-fastAPI


OCR on Google and Other Cloud Vision providers is too expensive.

This is a starter project for a server that provides OCR using Tesseract and FastAPI.

Tesseract is opensource and free. You can check out the documentation here: https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
